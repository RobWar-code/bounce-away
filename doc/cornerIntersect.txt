Corner Intersect

<h1>Introduction
	This document describes the algorithm for working-out corner
	bounces / intersections for the bat.

<h1>Procedure
	The first step is to establish whether a vector of the ball
	from some point oldX,oldY to newX,newY would (or has) intersected
	the arc. In other words are there one or more points P along the vector
	where the distance between testX, testY and arcX, arcY is less than
	or equal to ballR + arcR, we could say what is the MINIMUM distance
	between testX, testY and arcX, arcY on the vector?

	Check with chatGPT:

function findClosestPointAndDistance(ax, ay, lax, lay, lbx, lby) {
    // Direction vector of the line
    const dx = lbx - lax;
    const dy = lby - lay;

    // Vector from A to P (lax, lay)
    const APx = ax - lax;
    const APy = ay - lay;

    // Projection of AP onto d
    const t = (APx * dx + APy * dy) / (dx * dx + dy * dy);

    // Closest point (cx, cy) on the line to (ax, ay)
    const cx = lax + t * dx;
    const cy = lay + t * dy;

    // Calculate the distance
    const distance = Math.sqrt((ax - cx) ** 2 + (ay - cy) ** 2);

    return { closestPoint: { x: cx, y: cy }, distance };
}



<h2>Procedure - Abandonned.

	This procedure relies on the radial vectors intersecting the arc. In 
	practice the ball may be wider than the arc, so this will not necessarily
	detect the intersection.

	Check each corner in turn to check whether the path of the last ball
	position to the current (check the upper and lower radial points
	perpendicular to the vector of motion as well as the centre of 
	the circle) intersects the corner.

	The right angles of the vector is dx/-dy, also -dx/dy
	normalise ody,odx to 1, ie: dy = ody / (ody^2 + odx^2) dx = odx / (ody^2 + odx^2)
	see function radialVectorPoints.

	Take the radial vectors of both ball positions and check whether they intersect
	the given corner. (see function lineCircleIntersects)

	If the corner arc is intersected:

		Determine the nearest point of intersection to the first position of the
		ball.

		The problem is then to determine the position of a circle such that it has
		the same tangent as the radial vector and intersects the corner arc at
		the same point as the radial vector.

		Phrasing this more clearly:

		I have two positions of a circle C1 of radius r whose centres (c1x, c1y), (c2x, c2y) 
		are travelling along a vector vx, vy such that on the way, the circle intersects 
		another circle C3 of radius r3 whose centre is at (c3x, c3y). The fact of the 
		intersection is established by finding the tangent of C1 (at radial point R1 (r1x, r1y) 
		of C1) that is parallel to vx, vy such that it crosses the C2 at the point i1x, i1y. 
		What is the position c4x, c4y of C1 such that the radial point lies on the intersect
		I1.

		We can workout c4x, c4y as follows:

			Take the vector parallel and opposite to the radial vector that gives rise to
			vector the C1 - R (C4 - I1) ie:
			dx/dy = -rdx/-rdy
			c4x = i1x + rdy/rdx * r
			c4y = i1y + rdx/rdy * r

		We now take the centres of C4 and C3 and measure the vector between in order to
		establish the translation along this of C4 to C5, at which point C5 is tangent
		(at the point of contact) between C3 and C5.

			dx = c4x - c3x
			dy = c4y - c3y
			dr = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)
			sr = r + r3 - dr

			We move along this vector for the distance sr from the centre c4.
			c5x = c4x + dy/dx * sr
			c5y = c4y + dx/dy * sr

			The bounce is then the vector produced by the vector vx, vy and this
			normal (dx,dy).

		These things are written as a function: movingCircleToCircleContactPosition()
